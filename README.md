# Time-series-stock-movement-in-decision-tree, XGB, and LSTM

## Story

Trying to using decision tree to find any predictive power of technical indicators (SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Volume) on stock prices using decision tree, xgboosting.

## Data

a stock I have positions in : MAXR.TO

## Conclusion
both pruned decision tree and xgboosting cannot reach a accuracy over 0.5 persistently on test dataset. 

## Next step
Try LSTM for Time-Series analysis.
Use high frequency data.
